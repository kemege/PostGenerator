PostGenerator for FDUPT
=======
This tool is used to generate introduction posts for movies or TV Dramas automatically.
The only infomation you need to provide is the IMDb ID of the movie. 
You can also specify a Douban ID so as to acquire more accurate Chinese information. If you don't give it, this script will try to search for a proper one with Douban API v2.

The template for movie posts is from **rosy**'s PTAid plugin, and the template for TV Dramas is provided by **hotshotxwl**.

Installation
